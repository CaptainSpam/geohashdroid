        <title>You Are Literally Reading What Changed</title>
        <header>At some point I'll ask myself why I included the version history for the previous version when you couldn't see that anyway, but at any rate...</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>The Version History dialog is ready.  You're reading it now, in fact.</bullet>
            <bullet>All dialogs other than the wiki login dialog now look like standard Android dialogs.  I might bring back the GHD theme when I've got a better way to do it.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the "Today" button not appearing on the date picker dialog on phones in landscape mode.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Next will probably be the missing images and the "you've made it" toast.</footer>

        <title>Hope Pre-Returns In A Pre-Release</title>
        <header>It's not quite done yet, but there's plenty to be said about this Geohash Droid overhaul.  Here's just some of what can be said.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Brand new, Fragment-based, Maps v2 interface.  Looks better on tablets than the old version!</bullet>
            <bullet>Lots more backgroundy.  Wiki stuff, especially.  You can send wiki posts even if there's no internet connection, and it'll queue them up for later when you DO have one.</bullet>
            <bullet>Much sleeker design that's sort of Materials-based, but not fully.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Missing stuff, like the About screen, a few missing images, and this Version History screen, will come later.  It IS a pre-release, after all.</footer>
