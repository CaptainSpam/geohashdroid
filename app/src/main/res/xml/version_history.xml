        <title>Working Hard</title>
        <header>Most of this update is a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>StockService and AlarmService (that which fetches stock values and that which wakes up the stock value fetcher at 9:30am ET, respectively) now use the AndroidX Worker structure, rather than JobIntentService, which may make them more reliable overall.  WikiService (that which posts wiki updates) is still my own ridiculous creation, though.</bullet>
            <bullet>All dialogs with a &quot;Stop Reminding Me&quot; option now have that as a checkbox instead of one of the dialog buttons, which makes a lot more design sense when you think about it.</bullet>
            <bullet>More general code cleanup that doesn&apos;t really do much but make things spiffier and shinier if you happen to write said code.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>If you follow the actual Git repo, you may note that this is in the master branch now, meaning I think it&apos;s almost ready for proper release...</footer>

        <title>Android v16 Was A Really Long Time Ago, Seriously</title>
        <header>This update&apos;s been a long time coming: It&apos;s time to update to a newer Android version!  A lot&apos;s changed here, and hopefully for the better.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Effectively all libraries and calls and such have been updated to AndroidX.  This cleans up a LOT of code and means things will try to take advantage of newer Androidy ways of doing stuff, which should make things go smoother.</bullet>
            <bullet>Also, do note that the minimum Android API has been bumped up to v23 (Android 7.1.1, Marshmallow, released in 2015).  I really hope there aren&apos;t people still on Jelly Bean devices using this.</bullet>
            <bullet>There&apos;s a proper dark mode now!  It reacts to Android&apos;s internal system dark mode setting if need be and available!  There&apos;s even a setting in Preferences that can force it to light/dark mode!  New colors!  (some) New icons!  Everything uses it!</bullet>
            <bullet>Well, everything except satellite and terrain maps.  I still don&apos;t have dark versions of those.</bullet>
            <bullet>The Street map will now become light or dark depending on what state the app is in.  This may mean your map setting might be wrong at first; if you change it a bit, it should fix itself.</bullet>
            <bullet>As a part of this, the overall app theme has been updated to something more modern, as the old theme didn&apos;t support Android&apos;s night mode mechanisms.  Everything should still be there, but might look a bit different.  The toolbar on the main map interface, for instance.  That may get another pass later.</bullet>
            <bullet>Vector icons!  Vector icons all OVER the place!  I mean, the originals have always been vectoriffic on my side, but now I don&apos;t need to rasterize them at like six different sizes.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>This particular version is a pre-release.  I hope someone picks it up and lets me know what&apos;s up.  Since this IS a pre-release, please let me know if something&apos;s amiss, moreso than usual.</footer>

            <bullet>The wiki file uploader should now correctly upload files with UTF-8 names (i.e. if your username has non-ASCII characters) and descriptions with UTF-8 characters.</bullet>
        </bullets>

            <bullet>The bug where wiki images for a given expedition from the same user all had the same filename (thus overwriting the old images on each new upload) should be fixed.</bullet>

        <title>Picture Locations From Picture Locations</title>
        <header>This one&apos;s bringing back an old feature that got disabled ages ago.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>There&apos;s a new option when making a picture post!  Now you can specify that the location should be derived from data in the picture itself (if possible), rather than the device&apos;s location.  This can be handy if you wait until you get home to post pictures.</bullet>
            <bullet>This does mean the wiki posting layout has been rearranged a little bit.  Keep an eye out.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Note that if you make a wiki post and it doesn&apos;t go through due to not having a network connection, it should still remember the location at the time you attempted the post.</footer>

        <title>A Fun Game Of Find-The-Version-History</title>
        <header>But wait, there&apos;s more!</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Thanks to what I think is an anonymous contributor (at least I&apos;m assuming that&apos;s what Github meant), when a wiki post is made, links to OSM should be better, in that they&apos;ll put a marker on the map and use the default layer options.</bullet>
            <bullet>I&apos;m pretty sure I removed the last references to the v1 Maps API.  I&apos;m not using v1 anyway, so I&apos;m not sure why the publishing console keeps insisting I am.  Hopefully that&apos;s taken care of now.  You probably won&apos;t notice anything.</bullet>
            <bullet>Version History (that is, this dialog) has moved to a button within About.  I felt that popup menu was getting cluttered, and Version History didn&apos;t seem to belong in the top-level menu anyway.  Note that it will still pop up on a new version regardless, which is most likely why you&apos;re reading this now.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>I might have the key idea I was missing for the UI changes that will finally bring in native dark/night mode.  I&apos;m hoping for as little disruption as possible in how this normally works.</footer>

        <title>Alarming Compatibility</title>
        <header>So I&apos;ve got this branch in the repository labeled &quot;androidx&quot;.  In it, there&apos;s a bunch of commits in my quest to convert a lot of my old code into more modern, AndroidX-ish stuff.  If you don&apos;t know what that means, don&apos;t worry about it, but I felt these changes may be important:</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>The stock precacher is now using AndroidX compatibility layer stuff.  This might fix a problem some users have seen with it excessively draining the battery.  Might.</bullet>
            <bullet>The stock fetching notification should no longer show up at all if the stock doesn&apos;t need to be fetched.  This should further save battery, because I think those notifications could wake up the screen under certain circumstances, even if they only show up for a moment as the cache is read.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>There&apos;s other changes in that branch that I haven&apos;t included in this update, but I don&apos;t think they really have any visible effect, so I left them out until I have more of them ready.  I&apos;ll get those up in a later version.</footer>

        <title>The Maze of Permissions</title>
        <header>This one slipped past me...</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Fixed wiki image posting.  There was an internal permissions issue I wasn&apos;t properly handling.  This fix should take care of that.  There is a chance that if you had any uploading issues before, you may get warnings about images not uploading properly next time you post.  These warnings should only show up once.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the year on the previous version note.  Oops.</bullet>
            <bullet>Also fixed the build date on the About screen.  I should really wire that into a build system script sometime.</bullet>

        <title>Excuse the Queues</title>
        <header>It&apos;s been a rough year for all, but there&apos;s finally an update!</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Completely overhauled how the wiki posting queue works.  This is a background thing that stores wiki posts for later if anything goes wrong (i.e. there&apos;s no internet connection).  Or rather, it SHOULD have been doing that, but the way I implemented it didn&apos;t work the way I planned it.  I&apos;ve gone back over it and hopefully made it far more bulletproof, so it should actually queue up anything you send if it can&apos;t get them posted for some reason.  Should be handy for those trips way away from data coverage.</bullet>
            <bullet>This also adds a new preference in the wiki section of the preferences screen to manually release any posts queued up (or at least try to).  If there was no internet connection when you tried sending the posts, Geohash Droid will automatically try to re-send everything once it detects one, unless Android decided to shut it down in the meantime.  However, in that case the posts should still be persisted in the app, so you can use this button to release anything currently on standby.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Do let me know on the GitHub page if anything went wrong.  I&apos;ve got more on the way, including more wiki options, slightly more night-mode support, and an overall UI refresh to bring things more up-to-date with modern Android sensibilities.  More to come, is all.</footer>

        <header>Wow, I&apos;ve got some work to do.  Did I mention I got a new job since the last update?</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>The Geohashing Wiki has moved!  As such, Geohash Droid now points there.</bullet>
            <bullet>Okay, THIS time I&apos;ve got the broken Version History entries fixed.  If you saw backslashed quotes show up in the previous version, that wasn&apos;t meant to be part of the joke; it turns out that, irritatingly, different versions of Android apparently parse single and double quotes in XML files differently.  Sorry for any confusion there.  Just remind me to always use &amp;apos; and &amp;quot; to be safe and everything should be fine.</bullet>
            <bullet>In the never-ending quest for fanciness and schmansiness, there&apos;s finally an adaptive-style icon for Geohash Droid.</bullet>
            <bullet>A few minor bugs here and there should be fixed.  I have no clue if anyone ran across them or not.</bullet>
            <bullet>A whoooooooole lotta code cleanup.  Library versions, linting, simplifying, the works.  If something exploded, do let me know.</bullet>

        <title>Eleven Notifications If You Count A Potential Globalhash</title>
        <header>FINALLY, the Oreo Notifications update!</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Notification channels!  Geohash Droid now uses Oreo-style notification channels!  There&apos;s channels for wiki-related issues, the stock pre-fetcher, and Known Locations.  You can configure them via app settings in your device&apos;s main Android settings.  Note that by default this means Known Location notifications will now make noise.</bullet>
            <bullet>New notification options regardless!  You can now have it send up individual Known Location notifications for each location that has a nearby point or each graticule with nearby points in them.  As the helpful popup will remind you, this is limited to ten notifications at a time.</bullet>
            <bullet>Updated all the map-related stuff to newer versions of the Google Play libraries.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed potentially broken Version History screen, specifically where every line with an apostrophe got cut off.  If this turned out to be a problem for you, hopefully it&apos;s fixed now and you don&apos;t see backslashes before every apostrophe in this window.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Some of these updates (mostly the map-related part) involved a lot more tearup than I was expecting.  I tested things as much as I could, but if you run into problems with this version, please file issues at the Github repo.</footer>

        <title>The Concept Of An Australian Tomorrow</title>
        <header>Here&apos;s a somewhat major change for geohashers in the 30W Rule.  You might like this one.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Notifications for Known Locations that are subject to the 30W Rule will now (generally) trigger for *tomorrow*, not necessarily the date of the NYSE stock value.  That is, instead of triggering for the date of the stock value, which isn&apos;t very useful in 30W graticules by the time the NYSE opens (especially in places like Australia, Japan, or New Zealand), the notification will be for the next day&apos;s hashpoints.  That, in a way, is why the 30W Rule was invented in the first place, so this makes more sense for graticules located there.</bullet>
            <bullet>The button that accepts the currently-selected graticule in Select-A-Graticule mode now says &quot;Use This&quot;, rather than &quot;Return&quot;.  That reads a lot better, I feel.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Thanks to ephphatha on GitHub for pointing the 30W notification issue out to me!  Totally forgot to account for that when I initially wrote it.</footer>

        <title>Nougat Caught In Your Teeth</title>
        <header>This update came up due to a vital change in Nougat I forgot to account for.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Fixed a problem where wiki posting and the stock pre-fetcher wouldn&apos;t wake back up if either were waiting for a network connection on Android N.</bullet>
            <bullet>In the event that wiki posting STILL doesn&apos;t wake up, tapping the notification that says it&apos;s waiting for a network connection will try to nudge it into action.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the existing actions on the wiki notifications not always working properly to begin with.</bullet>
            <bullet>Updated the wiki login method so it should continue working if the Geohashing wiki upgrades to 1.27 or newer.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>I&apos;m pretty sure I got the network connection wakeup bug fixed, but if there&apos;s still problems where wiki posting never realizes the network came back, please let me know on GitHub.</footer>

            <bullet>Fixed issue where the terrain and satellite map types were switched.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>I&apos;ve also got a branch I&apos;m working on that uses Android&apos;s internal night mode mechanics to handle the darker night interface.  But, since that depends on your device being Marshmallow or newer (anything lower and night mode only affects docked devices), that&apos;ll probably only go up on the GitHub site as a separate version.  More on that when it&apos;s ready to test.</footer>

        <title>Your Late-Night Geohash Fix</title>
        <header>Good news for anyone who might want a night mode...</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>There&apos;s a night mode!  It&apos;s not based on time, however.  Under the Map Type menu, you&apos;ll see a new &quot;Street (night)&quot; mode.  That&apos;ll make the map dark AND darken the app&apos;s theme in general (&quot;Street (day)&quot; changes it back).  Note that I can&apos;t get night versions of the satellite or terrain maps, so those will still always be bright.</bullet>
            <bullet>Added in a toast popup if you enter the map screen when a previous day&apos;s hashpoint is still active.  I&apos;ve been confused myself when that happens.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Now that Known Locations works like it should, I&apos;ve had a suggestion or two as to how the notifications could be improved, specifically in cases where there&apos;s locations marked that might be a long way away, or lots of locations to report, or whatnot.

        <header>Nougat!  It&apos;s the Nougat update!  Check this out:</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>For Nougat 7.0, Geohash Droid should behave a bit better with regards to multi-window mode.  Maybe.  I&apos;ve tested it as much as I can with a Pixel and a Nexus 9, but it should be somewhat sane and not-crashy.</bullet>
            <bullet>The Detailed Info and Wiki displays on tablets now look different.  Now they&apos;re smaller blocks that show up over the map, rather than taking over half the screen.</bullet>
            <bullet>For Nougat 7.1, there&apos;s a round icon (if your launcher supports them)!  Much like spinny things, everybody loves round things!</bullet>
            <bullet>Also for Nougat 7.1, there&apos;s launcher shortcuts (also if your launcher supports them; long-tap the icon to check)!  Now you can directly launch into either the last-used graticule, the closest hashpoint, or the graticule picker, regardless of whatever your preferences say!</bullet>
            <bullet>Updated marker strings to account for the Try Tomorrow menu option.</bullet>
            <bullet>Hopefully mitigated most of the issues with Known Locations not triggering notifications.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>As far as I know, the Known Locations issue is due to the Doze/App Idle feature of Marshmallow, and is not the easiest thing to fix.

Said coordinates will be in whatever format is shown on the screen as per your preferences (degrees/minutes/seconds).</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>I&apos;m also aware there&apos;s some issue with the Known Locations notifier (or, more specifically, the stock pre-fetcher which should be triggering said notifications).

If stock pre-fetching is on, those points will be checked for any nearby hashpoints (you can restrict each to its respective home Graticule) or the globalhash for the day, and you&apos;ll get a notification if anything&apos;s close enough.</bullet>
            <bullet>Remember how the pre-0.9.0 versions started with the Graticule selection screen and also remembered the last Graticule you used?  Now there&apos;s a preference (again, in Map Options) to have Geohash Droid start with either of those, rather than the default of picking the nearest hashpoint regardless of which Graticule it&apos;s in!</bullet>
            <bullet>In the options menu on the main expedition map, there&apos;s a brand new &quot;Try Tomorrow&quot; option.  That&apos;ll increment the date to tomorrow, just in case you wanted to check the entire weekend&apos;s worth of hashpoints quickly on a Friday.</bullet>
            <bullet>The InfoBox will now fade out if either your location or the final destination are directly underneath it.  Easier to see that way.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the fact that stock pre-fetching wasn&apos;t actually working the way it should have been.</bullet>
            <bullet>Updates to Play Services.</bullet>
            <bullet>The usual sort of minor fixes and such.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>The Known Locations system is the big thing here.  I did as much testing as I reasonably could, and I think it&apos;ll work the way I&apos;m expecting it to, but there might be some glitches.  Let me know (in GitHub) if something&apos;s really wrong with it.</footer>

        <title>Where The Streets Have No Name, And In Fact Aren&apos;t Even Shown On The Map</title>
        <header>One minor feature and one bug fix later...</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Geohash Droid will now remember the last map type you chose (street, satellite, terrain) and default to that when you start the app.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed a bug where if you were in expedition mode (the main mode, where you&apos;re not picking a Graticule) with an active Globalhash, it wasn&apos;t recognizing if you changed the active date.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>0.9.1 might be right around the corner.</footer>

        <title>-nodpi Means -nodpi</title>
        <header>Did you know the -nodpi resource qualifier is sometimes ignored in certain cases?  I didn&apos;t!</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Fixed an issue where sometimes the icons used to build up the infobox on wiki posts came out really really huge.</bullet>
            <bullet>The stock prefetch notification is now dismissable, in the rare event that it doesn&apos;t go away for some reason.</bullet>

        <footer>More actual features to come once I&apos;ve reworked a few things.</footer>

        <title>Picking Up The Fragments</title>
        <header>This should cover a slightly different device-specific issue.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Fixed the Graticule picker box not showing up on all devices.</bullet>
            <bullet>Also made the same picker more robust on devices where it DID show up.</bullet>
            <bullet>It also animates more smoothly.</bullet>

        <footer>Once again, thanks to George McBane for the help with tracking this down and making sure it was working.</footer>

        <title>Infinite Diversity In Infinite Combinations</title>
        <header>Hopefully this bug didn&apos;t affect you, but if it did...</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Fixed an issue where the stock price wasn&apos;t being properly downloaded for users of some Android devices.</bullet>
            <bullet>Or some firmwares.</bullet>
            <bullet>Or maybe some runtime environments.</bullet>
            <bullet>Point is, it should hopefully be working right now.</bullet>

        <title>Maybe Not ALL Of Google Play Services</title>
        <header>Just a minor update this time.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Trimmed down the amount of Google Play APIs used.  This should cut things down a bit and allows me to mark Geohash Droid as ad-free on the store without complaints.  It also means the app won&apos;t have that odd &quot;Accounts&quot; permission switch that never gets used.</bullet>
            <bullet>Updated to version 8.3.0 of the Play Services I DO use.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Let me know if I missed any permissions checks that the new Play Services need.</footer>

        <bullets>
            <bullet>Completely redone Fragment-based, materials-ish interface.  Your tablet will thank you.</bullet>
            <bullet>Brand-new Google Maps v2 API.  Navigate in comfort and style!</bullet>
            <bullet>Marshmallow permissions, where appropriate.</bullet>
            <bullet>All wiki calls are in the background, so you can queue up multiple requests if you don&apos;t have an internet connection.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the problem where you couldn&apos;t post to the wiki for a while regardless.  Whoops.</bullet>
            <bullet>Newer, crisper graphics.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>This version should work basically as well as the previous 0.7 versions.  If something goes wrong, file issues at the GitHub repository.  Now, hopefully I can get some NEW features going...</footer>
