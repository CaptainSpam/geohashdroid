        <title>Maybe Not ALL Of Google Play Services</title>
        <header>Just a minor update this time.</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Trimmed down the amount of Google Play APIs used.  This should cut things down a bit and allows me to mark Geohash Droid as ad-free on the store without complaints.  It also means the app won't have that odd "Accounts" permission switch that never gets used.</bullet>
            <bullet>Updated to version 8.3.0 of the Play Services I DO use.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>Let me know if I missed any permissions checks that the new Play Services need.</footer>

        <title>A New Day Dawns Over The 30W Line</title>
        <header>It's here!  It's here!  The revamped Geohash Droid is finally here!  Seriously, just look at this:</header>
        <bullets>
            <bullet>Completely redone Fragment-based, materials-ish interface.  Your tablet will thank you.</bullet>
            <bullet>Brand-new Google Maps v2 API.  Navigate in comfort and style!</bullet>
            <bullet>Marshmallow permissions, where appropriate.</bullet>
            <bullet>All wiki calls are in the background, so you can queue up multiple requests if you don't have an internet connection.</bullet>
            <bullet>Fixed the problem where you couldn't post to the wiki for a while regardless.  Whoops.</bullet>
            <bullet>Newer, crisper graphics.</bullet>
        </bullets>
        <footer>This version should work basically as well as the previous 0.7 versions.  If something goes wrong, file issues at the GitHub repository.  Now, hopefully I can get some NEW features going...</footer>
